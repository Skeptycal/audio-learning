# TensorFlow Audio model Demo

This demo imports the
[TensorFlow Simple Audio Recognition Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio_recognition)
model for inference in the browser. The model was pre-converted to TensorFlow.js
format and hosted on Google Cloud.

The following commands will start a web server on `localhost:1234` and open
a browser page with the demo.

```bash
cd demo # If not already in the demo directory.
yarn # Installs dependencies.
yarn watch # Starts a web server and opens a page. Also watches for changes.
```
